## Getting Started

Head to the [ZeroDev dashboard](https://dashboard.zerodev.app/).  Here, create a project for a network of your choice.  Copy the project ID as you will be using it in the next steps.

With your project set up, follow these simple steps to run the demo locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Danimal01/zerodev-danimalDemo
cd zerodev-danimalDemo
yarn install
export REACT_APP_ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
vercel dev
```

Now the demo should be running on localhost!
